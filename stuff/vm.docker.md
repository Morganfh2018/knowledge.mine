### Ambiente de desenvolvimento

* [Building a Development Environment with Docker | Terse Systems](http://tersesystems.com/2013/11/20/building-a-development-environment-with-docker/)

* [[SlideShare] Docker and Containers for Development and Deployment — SCALE12X](http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-containers-for-development-and-deployment-scale12x) - Docker is an Open Source engine to build, run, and manage containers. We'll explain what are Linux Containers, what powers them (under the hood), and what extra value Docker brings to the table. Then we'll see what the typical Docker workflow looks like from a developer point of view. We'll also give an Ops perspective, including deployment options.
